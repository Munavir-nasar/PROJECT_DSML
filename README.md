Train Delay Prediction _Classification 


## OVERVIEW

This project analyze and Predict whether a train is delayed or ontime.Machine learning techniques are used for this Prediction.Predicting whether a train journey will be "On Time" or "Delayed" can help railway operators manage resources more effectively and improve passenger satisfaction.

## USED TECHNIQUES 

Python
 
Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project begins with data exploration, which includes:

Handling missing values and outliers

Visualizing feature distributions


## MACHINE LEARNING MODELS 


The following classification machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting 

Support Vector Machine

k-Nearest Neighbor


## Performance Metrics Evaluated:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

## Key Findings 

By predicting unseen data to the  model we can see a  accurate result according to  the actual data points.

## Conclusion 

This project focus on the behaviour of trains using different  correlated features. 
This project will demonstrate the power of Machine learning models.# PROJECT_DSML
